TASK [java uninstall] ************************************************************************************************************************************************
[WARNING]: Consider using the yum module rather than running 'yum'.  If you need to use command because yum is insufficient you can add 'warn: false' to this command
task or set 'command_warnings=False' in ansible.cfg to get rid of this message.
changed: [172.31.2.235]

will use command module only for packages we cant install from yum like

amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y

if we use this there will be no warning because from yum we cant install

we declare variables in {{}} double flowe brackets

we can declare variables in run time also
