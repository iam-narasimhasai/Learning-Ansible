Ansible Inventory : list of servers

there are two types of inventories:

static and dynamic

playbook - yaml language

Playbook is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks or configurations to be applied to a set of hosts

master and slaves are connected through ssh


yum install -y python-pip
python --version
useradd ansible
passwd ansible
visudo 100th line
ansible ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 63rd line
passwordauthentication yes
systemctl restart sshd

amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y

cd /etc/ansible

ansible.config then enable inventory and sudo_user

inventory path : inventory      = /etc/ansible/hosts

su - ansible

ssh-copy-id ansible@172.31.2.235
ansible all -m ping check all servers
